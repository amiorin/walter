  "The DAG the launcher runs, and the two steps that are not a tool.

  Create and build provision the machine, then fork into the two Ansible
  stages, which are independent:

      start ─ tofu-compute ─┬─ ansible-local
                            └─ ansible-remote

  Delete runs it in reverse, dropping the managed SSH config and the rendered
  playbook before the machine they configured is destroyed.

  Walter has a single Tofu stage and therefore no join, which is the main way
  this graph is simpler than Once's."
